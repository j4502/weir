      <p>In this Afric Temple of the Whale I leave you, reader, and if you be a Nantucketer, and a whaleman, you will silently worship there.</p>

      <p>Inasmuch, then, as this Leviathan comes floundering down upon us from the head-waters of the Eternities, it may be fitly inquired, whether, in the long course of his generations, he has not degenerated from the original bulk of his sires.</p>

      <p>But upon investigation we find, that not only are the whales of the present day superior in magnitude to those whose fossil remains are found in the Tertiary system (embracing a distinct geological period prior to man), but of the whales found in that Tertiary system, those belonging to its latter formations exceed in size those of its earlier ones.</p>

      <p>Of all the pre-adamite whales yet exhumed, by far the largest is the Alabama one mentioned in the last chapter, and that was less than seventy feet in length in the skeleton. Whereas, we have already seen, that the tape-measure gives seventy-two feet for the skeleton of a large sized modern whale. And I have heard, on whalemen's authority, that Sperm Whales have been captured near a hundred feet long at the time of capture.</p>

      <p>But may it not be, that while the whales of the present hour are an advance in magnitude upon those of all previous geological periods; may it not be, that since Adam's time they have degenerated?</p>

      <p>"How far is it to the Emerald City?" the girl asked.</p>

      <p>"I do not know," answered Boq gravely, "for I have never been there. It is better for people to keep away from Oz, unless they have business with him.  But it is a long way to the Emerald City, and it will take you many days.  The country here is rich and pleasant, but you must pass through rough and dangerous places before you reach the end of your journey."</p>

      <p>This worried Dorothy a little, but she knew that only the Great Oz could help her get to Kansas again, so she bravely resolved not to turn back.</p>

      <p>She bade her friends good-bye, and again started along the road of yellow brick.  When she had gone several miles she thought she would stop to rest, and so climbed to the top of the fence beside the road and sat down.  There was a great cornfield beyond the fence, and not far away she saw a Scarecrow, placed high on a pole to keep the birds from the ripe corn.</p>

      <p>Dorothy leaned her chin upon her hand and gazed thoughtfully at the Scarecrow.  Its head was a small sack stuffed with straw, with eyes, nose, and mouth painted on it to represent a face.  An old, pointed blue hat, that had belonged to some Munchkin, was perched on his head, and the rest of the figure was a blue suit of clothes, worn and faded, which had also been stuffed with straw.  On the feet were some old boots with blue tops, such as every man wore in this country, and the figure was raised above the stalks of corn by means of the pole stuck up its back.</p>

      <p>'Not yet, not yet!' the Rabbit hastily interrupted. 'There's a great  deal to come before that!'</p>

      <p>'Call the first witness,' said the King; and the White Rabbit blew three  blasts on the trumpet, and called out, 'First witness!'</p>

      <p>The first witness was the Hatter. He came in with a teacup in one  hand and a piece of bread-and-butter in the other. 'I beg pardon, your  Majesty,' he began, 'for bringing these in: but I hadn't quite finished  my tea when I was sent for.'</p>

      <p>'You ought to have finished,' said the King. 'When did you begin?'</p>

      <p>The Hatter looked at the March Hare, who had followed him into the  court, arm-in-arm with the Dormouse. 'Fourteenth of March, I think it  was,' he said.</p>
